## New features
* `ggplot` methods for all functional data classes.
* Simulation of univariate functional data on higher-dimensional domains.
* Math functions such as `log()` or `abs()` can be applied to all functional data classes.
* Coercion from `funData` to `irregFunData` class via `as.irregFunData` (useful e.g. for plotting).
* Scalar product method for multivariate functional data accepts weight vector.
* Unit test coverage is now close to 100%.
